# cidfish-computer-vision

## Motivation
Mauricio Cid is a famous brazilian personality known for his humor blog [NÃ£o Salvo](http://www.naosalvo.com.br) which recently started streaming at [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/cidcidoso/). Every now and then he watches MTV's reality show Catfish with his community, developing an entire lore full of internal jokes and positive moments.

The problem though is that not everyone can watch the streams live and those sessions are not tagged, so members of the community suffer to find at which VODs Cid watched Catfish and the time it started.

This project aims to help Cid and his community in identifying and cataloging those sessions through the use of computer vision techniques as well as allowing me an introduction to the subject.

## Action Plan
1. Scrape Cid's twitch for video URL's
1. Use OpenCV to identify when Catfish sessions started
